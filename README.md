Project Title: What if...?

Project Overview:

What if there were a place where your weirdest, funniest, and most thought-provoking ideas came to life?
"What If..." is a web application in which users can anonymously post their "What If" fantasies. Through choosing their animal identity, there is no standard protocol or fear of judgment for posting one's own merely random, silly, and intrusive thoughts. The space challenges creativity and imagination as a fun and unique place to engage in bizarre thought experiments and become one with a community of like-minded individuals.

**Core Features:**

- Voting System – User can upvote or react the most mind-blowing "What If" posts on scale of realistic, possible, impossible, absolutely insane.

- Randomizer Button- Tap to pull a random what if thought of user submitted ones.

- Categories Organize content in subjects like Sci-fi, Dark humor, Everyday life or Existential crises etc.

- Leader board- See the top-voted posts trending at real time.

- What If. Battle Royale – Two outlandish ideas duke it out in a community vote.

- Story Time – A section where users can share and build on their "What If" ideas, developing into the Butterfly Effect-type of story. E.g.-"What if humans had tails?" -> Tail fashion -> Tails replace handshakes.


**Tech stack:**

*Frontend*:
- Framework: React.js (for highly dynamic and responsive UI).
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (to make it visually appealing).
- Animations: Framer Motion (for smooth animations and transitions).

*Backend:*
- Framework: Node.js with Express.js (for handling real-time features, like live voting, chat).
- Database: MongoDB (for storing the data like user posts, votes).
- Other APIs: OpenAI API (for avatars).

*Deployment:*
- Vercel (for frontend hosting).
- Render or Heroku (for deploying backend).


**Why this project?**

The purpose of the **What If.?** website is to give users a safe, fun space where they can anonymously share and explore their wildest, funniest, or most thought-provoking "What If" ideas. It allows creativity and imagination to flourish and for people to engage in bizarre thought experiments and connect with like-minded individuals without judgment, while it also offers other interactive features, such as voting, storytelling, and live battles between ideas. It is an entertaining community-driven platform for creative expression and fun.

**Learnings from this Project**

At the end of the completion of "What If" the key skills I would be taking away are as follows:

Frontend(HTML, CSS, JS, React.js)
Backend (Node.js, Express.js)
API Integration
